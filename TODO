# Priority:
Examine why presidents won.
Allow removing something added with add another (tricky when trying to remove last one).
Add another doesn't work with form (as opposed to subform).
Errors (esp. with AJAX)
More tests
CSRF protection
File upload
AJAX (for forms)

# Lower Priority:
Make a search component (how to make this secure? post back to component?).
Integrate Select2.js with components better.
Table dragability / "Snap to grid"
Expand table rows.
Editable table rows.

# Very Hard:
Rethink Filler supporting libraries. (Allow circular database references.)
Rethink Authorization supporting libraries.
Cache forms
