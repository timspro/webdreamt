Are scripts secure enough?
Is setting database information via directly editing Box.php a good idea?

class JobForm extends Form {

}

new JobForm('job');

//Required
//Better support for labels
//Order
//Alias
//CSRF protection
//Default group support.
//How would you do a login form?
//Search Component
//Form viewer
//Integrate Select2.js/Chosen with form component

//Grunt?

Outline for Eventual Layout:
Different modules of Web Dreamt should be in their own composer projects.
This might be divided up as follows:
Server/Authentication/Authorization
Filler
Builder
Hyper (Cache)
Box/Common Functions/Classes

Furthermore, additional, experimental code can be in its own private repository.
