Cache forms, but how to do it for rows?

# Maybe?:
Update Septic 360
A way to do ad hoc forms. For example, how would you do a login form? Maybe make login form a script.

Better input controls - currency, phone-number - although this could probably be handled by third party.
Maybe split up Group into two classes.
Split up WebDreamt components into different repositories.

Other Thoughts:
WebDreamt might be divided up as follows:
Server/Authentication/Authorization Classes
Filler
Builder
Hyper (Cache)
Box/Common Functions/Other Classes
