# Priority:
Examine why presidents won.
CSRF protection (requires changing to POSTs for deletes as we don't know the domain name to check referer)
File upload
Errors (esp. with AJAX)
AJAX (for forms)
More tests
Add another doesn't work with form (as opposed to subform).


# Lower Priority:
Make a search component (how to make this secure? post back to component?).
Integrate Select2.js with components better.
Table dragability / "Snap to grid"
Expand table rows.
Editable table rows.

# Very Hard:
Rethink Filler supporting libraries. (Allow circular database references.)
Rethink Authorization supporting libraries.
Cache forms
