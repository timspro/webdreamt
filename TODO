# Easy:
Date time tests.
Required tests.
Add tests for command line and for guarantee.
Order Test
Alias Test

# Medium: 
Make a Search Component.
Integrate Select2.js with Components.
CSRF protection
Add default group support for authorization.
Better support for labels in Groups. Also class labels?
Better form tests.
File upload.
Add extra component before a column.
Ajax Form
Draggability

# Hard:
Authorization Manager
Fork bower-installer.
Validation

# Very Hard:
Rethink Filler supporting libraries.
Rethink Authorization supporting libraries.
Cache forms, but how to do it for rows?

# Maybe?:
Update Septic 360
A way to do ad hoc forms. For example, how would you do a login form? Maybe make login form a script.

# Not Implemented:
Placeholders?
Better input controls - currency, phone-number - although this could probably be handled by third party.
Maybe split up Group into two classes.
Split up WebDreamt components into different repositories.

Other Thoughts:
WebDreamt might be divided up as follows:
Server/Authentication/Authorization Classes
Filler
Builder
Hyper (Cache)
Box/Common Functions/Other Classes
