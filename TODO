# Easy:
Date time tests.
Required tests.
Add tests for command line and for guarantee.
Order Test
Alias Test
Label in Display Test
Class Label Test
Examine why presidents won.
getValueFromInput
Is default handled correctly in getValueFromInput?
Should we allow multiple callbacks to be set?
Make groups numerable
Placeholder

# Medium:
Make a Search Component.
Integrate Select2.js with Components.
CSRF protection
Add default group support for authorization.
Better form tests.
File upload.
Ajax Form
Draggability
Expand table rows.
Editable table rows
Make a display column function for group/display. Refactor group. Refactor table as a group with display
Set html tag. Make a function that iterates over columns. Perhaps make render linked just return empty.
"Snap to grid"
Refactor some functions into "Common" class that contains pluralize, deleteDirectory, etc.

# Hard:
Authorization Manager
Fork bower-installer.
Validation

# Very Hard:
Rethink Filler supporting libraries. (Allow circular database references.)
Rethink Authorization supporting libraries.
Cache forms, but how to do it for rows?

# Maybe?:
Update Septic 360
A way to do ad hoc forms. For example, how would you do a login form? Maybe make login form a script.

# Not Implemented:
Placeholders?
Better input controls - currency, phone-number - although this could probably be handled by third party.
Maybe split up Group into two classes.
Split up WebDreamt components into different repositories.

Other Thoughts:
WebDreamt might be divided up as follows:
Server/Authentication/Authorization Classes
Filler
Builder
Hyper (Cache)
Box/Common Functions/Other Classes

Create/Update/Delete, tables and columns

//Modify link to disable Propel object.
Change name for a multiple select to $name[] / Add multiple option to Select / Make sure Server's batch() can handle arrays.
Overwrite renderLinkedComponents to add a hidden input for the form telling what Propel method
should be used / Modify server to understand this
Add some JavaScript for add another button.
Are things being added in the server in the right order?
Get the id from the current form?
We could just mostly kick this into JavaScript?

To deal with the reference issue:
Make it so that any extra Forms when linked will have access to the linking form ID.
