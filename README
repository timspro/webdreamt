# To Install:

## First: Installing WebDreamt's PHP Code

Install WebDreamt via Composer. If you don't know how to do this, it is actually pretty easy, but
I won't explain it here; just look at Composer's website.

## Second: Installing WebDreamt's CSS and JavaScript Code

A) The simplest method is to just look at the included files in the `js`, `css`, `img`, and `font` folders
in the `vendor/timspro/webdreamt` directory and copy those to the corresponding place in your project.

B) If you want to have a robust solution that takes into account that the CSS and JavaScript
dependencies of WebDreamt might change, use Bower to install WebDreamt's JavaScript and CSS files,
and then use Grunt to merge the files together and create minified versions of the files. You can
look at bower.json and Gruntfile.js in `vendor/timspro/webdreamt` to see how I do this for WebDreamt.
Note that I make use of a tool called `bower-installer` to get only the needed files from given
Bower repositories, which must be installed separately from bower.

# Third: Configuring WebDreamt

Create a new PHP script (It can either be run via command line or browser) and write:
```
$box = new \WebDreamt\Box();
$box->DatabaseHost = "localhost"; //Use your database host
$box->DatabaseName = "";          //Use your database name
$box->DatabaseUsername = "root";  //Use your database username
$box->DatabasePassword = "";      //Use your database password
$box->script()->manager();
```
This sets up a way to update the database and Propel schema.

Note just running this script will allow you to use the WebDreamt packages since WebDreamt
will recognize that it hasn't been setup and so will set itself up based on the database.
However, step four will show how you how to use commands to work with WebDreamt.
At the very least, you will want to use the "Update Propel" command to update Propel when
database changes are made.

# Fourth: Working with WebDreamt

WebDreamt provides a number of different scripts to help you work with the library, which you can
include from your own scripts. These are currently are:

A) authorization.php: A browser-based script to allow creating and editing groups and their
basic permissions to modify tables and tables' columns in the database.

B) manager.php: A browser-based or command-line script to issue commands to WebDreamt to manipulate
Propel and the database.

C) push-with-db.php: A command-line script which adds all modified files to the local git repository,
commits the modified files, pulls any changes, pushes the local changes, checks for WebDreamt updates,
updates the database schema, dumps the composer autoload, deletes the data in the database, and
fills the database with random data.

D) push.php: A command-line script which adds all modified files to the local git repository,
commits the modified files, pulls any changes, pushes the local changes, and dumps the composer
autoload.

All of these are located in `vendor/timspro/webdreamt/script`. It is strongly recommended that you
secure these files if you place them on a public server. Also, feel free to look at the source code
and adapt the scripts to your needs.
