# To Install:

## First:

Install WebDreamt via Composer. If you don't know how to do this, it is actually pretty easy, but 
I won't explain it here; just look at Composer's website.

## Second:

A) If you want to be lazy, just look at the included files in the `js`, `css`, `img`, and `font` folders 
in the `vendor/timspro/WebDreamt` directory and copy those to the corresponding place in your project.

B) If you want to have a robust solution that takes into account that the CSS and JavaScript 
dependencies of WebDreamt might change, use Bower to install WebDreamt's JavaScript and CSS files, 
and then use Grunt to merge the files together and create minified versions of the files. You can
look at bower.json and Gruntfile.js in `vendor/timspro/WebDreamt` to see how I do this. Note
that I make use of a tool called `bower-installer` to get only the needed files from given 
bower repositories, which must be installed separately from bower.

# Third:

Create a new PHP script (It can either be run via command line or browser) and write:
```
$box = new \WebDreamt\Box();
$box->DatabaseHost = "localhost";
$box->DatabaseName = "";
$box->DatabaseUsername = "root";
$box->DatabasePassword = "";
$box->script()->manager();
```
This sets up a way to update the database and Propel schema.

Note just running this script will allow you to use the WebDreamt packages.* However, step four will 
show how you how to use commands to work with WebDreamt.
At the very least, you will want to use the "Update Propel" command to update Propel when
database changes are made.

# Fourth:

A) If you want to run the script via command line, you can navigate to the script's directory
in the command line and run PHP on the script. You can use the argument --help to see a list of 
commands.

B) If you want to run the script via web browser, you can navigate to the script via a URL and
use the web form. Given the commands (such as destroy database), you should not let this URL be 
publicly visible on a production server, although there is no risk of having arbitrary code running
on the server or database information being leaked via the form.

You can easily make a custom version of this script by looking at the source code in the 
`vendor/timspro/WebDreamt/script` folder at the manager.php file.

* This because when the Box is initialized, WebDreamt checks to see if it can find the 
generated schema in `db/propel/schema.xml`, and if not, it knows it should generate the schema based 
on the database.
